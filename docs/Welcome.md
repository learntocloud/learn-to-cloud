## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What do I need before starting?</strong></summary>

The only requirements are motivation and discipline—these are aspects we cannot provide for you. Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much does this cost?</strong></summary>

No cost, no account needed, nothing. You have no excuses. L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long will this take?</strong></summary>

Self paced. However, you could realistically cover everything in 6 months with about 2 hours per day and more on weekends.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this for complete beginners?</strong></summary>

Yes! Phase 0 starts from zero. No prior tech experience required—just motivation and willingness to learn.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I skip phases if I already have experience?</strong></summary>

Yes, but with a caveat: the capstone projects build on each other starting from Phase 2. Even if you're comfortable with a topic, we recommend completing the capstones to get the full experience.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which cloud provider should I choose?</strong></summary>

We recommend picking ONE (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and sticking with it. All three have free tiers. Choose based on job market demand in your area or personal interest.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need certifications?</strong></summary>

Certifications can help, but they're not required. Focus on building real projects and demonstrating practical skills. We include certification prep resources where relevant.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from other resources?</strong></summary>

We don't handhold. We give you direction, context, and curated resources—then expect you to figure things out. This mirrors real-world cloud engineering work.
