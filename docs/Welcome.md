> **Your free, open-source guide to becoming a cloud engineer.**

Learn to Cloud (L2C) is a courseware built on the belief that anyone can learn foundational cloud engineering skills with the right guide and discipline.

This guide is focused on helping you learn the skillset of a junior cloud engineer, not ANY other role.

## 🤑 Cost?

No cost, no account needed, nothing. You have no excuses. L2C is open source and free, and the resources we recommend are either free or very affordable.

## ⌚️ Time?

Self paced. However, you could realistically cover everything in 6 months with about 2 hours per day and more on weekends.

## 💪🏽 What do you need to know before starting?

The only requirements are motivation and discipline - these are aspects we cannot provide for you.

Breaking into tech has never been easy, despite what some content creators might suggest. This journey will be challenging, but if you have a genuine interest in cloud engineering, it will be worth your effort.

**Good luck on your journey!**
