# Cloud Security Certifications

## Certification Roadmap for Junior Engineers

As a junior cloud engineer interested in security, it can be overwhelming to decide which certifications to pursue. Here's a suggested pathway to build your cloud security expertise:

### Step 1: Foundational Cloud Certifications
Start with a basic cloud certification to understand the platforms before specializing in security:

| Cloud Provider | Beginner Certification | Time to Prepare | Description |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| AWS | [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) | 1-2 months | Broad introduction to AWS services and concepts |
| Azure | [Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) | 1-2 months | Basic understanding of Azure services and cloud concepts |
| GCP | [Google Cloud Digital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-digital-leader) | 1-2 months | Fundamental knowledge of Google Cloud capabilities |

### Step 2: Associate-Level Certifications
Once you have the basics, move to these intermediate certifications that include security components:

| Cloud Provider | Associate Certification | Focus Areas |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------|
| AWS | [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) | Architecture, Security, Network |
| Azure | [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/) | Implementation, Security, Monitoring |
| GCP | [Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer) | Operations, Security, Management |

### Step 3: Security Specialization
After gaining general cloud experience, focus on security-specific certifications:

| Provider | Security Certification | Difficulty Level | Key Topics |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|------------|
| AWS | [AWS Certified Security - Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/) | Intermediate-Advanced | Data protection, IAM, Incident Response |
| Microsoft | [Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate (SC-200)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/security-operations-analyst/) | Intermediate | Threat Monitoring, Incident Response |
| Microsoft | [AZ-500: Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-security-engineer/) | Intermediate | Identity Management, Platform Protection |
| Google | [Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-security-engineer) | Intermediate-Advanced | Infrastructure Security, IAM, Compliance |
| Vendor-Neutral | [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) | Beginner-Intermediate | General Security Fundamentals |

## Well Known Vendor Certs

Every major cloud service provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) has some sort of security certification. At the time of writing this none of them are actually practical certifications. They are multiple choice and scenario-based exams. However, don't let this discourage you from actually getting your hands dirty. Any practical, labs-based, project-based, etc is going to sink your learning home. Many employers do recognize the competency and attestation that comes with these vendor certifications even if there are better options out there to learn the material for you.
