# Topic 5: Threat Detection and Incident Response

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 2-3 days

Incident response is about being prepared to handle security events when they occur. Before implementing automated threat detection for your Journal API, you need to understand threat detection principles and incident response workflows.

## 📚 Learning Path

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you will understand:

- Common cloud security threats and attack vectors
- Incident response lifecycle and best practices
- Automated threat detection and response concepts
- How to design effective incident response workflows
- Threat intelligence and threat hunting basics

## Core Learning Resources

### 1. Read: Incident Response Fundamentals
Start with these foundational guides:

- [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) - Read sections 1-3
- [SANS Incident Response Process](https://www.sans.org/white-papers/33901/) - Overview of incident response
- [MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/) - Common cloud attack techniques

### 2. Watch: Incident Response in Practice
- [Incident Response Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z2VK0C8cGU) (40 minutes)
- [AWS Incident Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh7wugyv3SY) (35 minutes)
- [Cloud Threat Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6W_4MaCH5E) (45 minutes)

### 3. Learn: Cloud Security Threats
- [OWASP Cloud Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-cloud-security/)
- [Cloud Security Alliance Threat Research](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/threat-research/)

## Key Concepts to Master

### Incident Response Lifecycle
1. **Preparation**: Plan, train, and set up tools before incidents occur
2. **Detection & Analysis**: Identify and understand security events
3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**: Stop the threat and restore normal operations
4. **Post-Incident Activity**: Learn from incidents to improve future response

### Common Cloud Threats
- **Account Compromise**: Stolen credentials or API keys
- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Resource Hijacking**: Using your cloud resources for malicious purposes
- **Misconfigurations**: Accidentally exposing resources publicly
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or third-party services

### Automated Response Concepts
- **Security Orchestration**: Coordinating responses across multiple tools
- **Playbooks**: Predefined response procedures for common incidents
- **Threat Intelligence**: Using external threat data to improve detection
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detecting anomalies in user and system behavior

### Incident Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to business operations or data
- **High**: Significant security impact requiring rapid response
- **Medium**: Security concern requiring investigation
- **Low**: Minor security event for awareness and documentation
