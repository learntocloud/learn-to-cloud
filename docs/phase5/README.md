# Phase 5: Securing Your Cloud Applications

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 3-4 weeks
> 
> Author: [Ethan Troy](https://hackidle.com)

Welcome to Phase 5! This phase focuses on securing the cloud applications and infrastructure you've built throughout your journey. You'll take the Journal API application from previous phases and implement enterprise-grade security controls, monitoring, and incident response capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will:

- Secure the Journal API application with proper IAM controls
- Implement data protection and secrets management
- Configure network security and secure connectivity
- Set up security monitoring and alerting systems
- Build automated threat detection and incident response
- Complete a comprehensive security implementation project

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Phase 3: Cloud Platform Fundamentals (have deployed infrastructure)
- Completed Phase 4: DevOps Fundamentals (recommended but not required)
- Access to the Journal API application and infrastructure from previous phases
- A cloud platform account (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with administrative permissions

---

## 🔗 How This Phase Builds on Your Journey

This phase takes the practical foundation you've built in Phases 1-4 and adds the security layer that makes your applications production-ready:

| Phase | How It Connects |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1-2** | Use your Linux and programming skills to configure security tools |
| **Phase 3** | Secure the cloud resources and networking you deployed |
| **Phase 4** | Add security scanning and monitoring to your CI/CD pipelines |
| **Phase 5** | Make everything production-ready with enterprise security controls |

:::tip Security is not separate
Security isn't a separate discipline—it's an essential skill that enhances every aspect of cloud engineering.
