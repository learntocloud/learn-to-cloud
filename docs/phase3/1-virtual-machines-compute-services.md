## 📚 Learning Path

- Study
  - What are [Compute Services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/compute/)
  - Understanding [Virtualization](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/virtualization/)
  - Instance Types & OS Selection: Choosing the right VM specs (CPU, RAM, storage)
  - Deploying Virtual Machines on [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute#create-your-first-vm)
