If you have zero tech experience and want to get into Cloud Engineering. This phase is for you. 

If you are already in tech and switching to cloud, go to [Phase 1: Linux and Networking fundamentals](../phase1/README.md).

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

Before diving into cloud-specific topics, it's crucial to grasp the basics of IT. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlGHY8ObL8DiyP3AIu9vd3K) is a fantastic overview.

The video playlist above will introduce you to several key concepts, but let's delve a bit deeper:

   - **[What is Linux](https://youtu.be/PwugmcN1hf8):** The backbone of many cloud environments, understanding Linux is crucial for cloud computing.
   - **[What is Networking](https://youtu.be/3QhU9jd03a0):** Learn how data moves across networks, an essential skill for any cloud engineer.
   - **[What is Programming](https://youtu.be/ifo76VyrBYo):** Basic programming knowledge is essential for automating tasks and managing cloud resources.
   - **[What is Cloud Computing](https://youtu.be/eZLcyTxi8ZI):** Understand the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including its benefits and service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
   - **[What is DevOps](https://youtu.be/9pZ2xmsSDdo/):** Learn about the practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle.
   - **[What is a Cloud Engineer and how to become one](https://youtu.be/7i1WMGxyt4Q):** What does a cloud engineer do, and what are the steps to become one?


## Things you should be able familiar with at the end of this phase

1. Have a clear understanding of the basics of IT and cloud computing.
2. Be prepared for continuous learning, as the tech field is ever-evolving.
3. Decide if you are committed to pursuing a career in tech.


## Certifications you might want to look into 

**An industry standard for people getting into tech is the [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a).**

- Is it necessary? No.
- Is it helpful? It depends on your learning style.
- Did I take it? No.
- Should you take it? It can be beneficial for your resume and may help you land support roles.

## Entry-Level Jobs

Starting in a support role is a great way to enter the tech industry. These positions are often entry-level friendly and may offer educational material and certification reimbursement.
