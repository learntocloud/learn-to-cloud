# Topic 4: Databases

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 3-4 days

We will be using a database to store our application data. For this we need to first understand how databases work and how to interact with them.

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Study SQL basics:** [Intro to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)

2. **Choose your cloud database:**

   | Cloud | Database | Tutorial |
   |-------|----------|----------|
   | AWS | DynamoDB | [DynamoDB Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k2GINpO308) |
   | Azure | Cosmos DB | [Cosmos DB Essentials Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLasX02E8BPDd2fKwLCHnmWoyo4bL-oKr&feature=shared/) |

3. **Complete the Python quickstart for your chosen database:**
   - [AWS DynamoDB Python Quickstart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/example_dynamodb_Scenario_GettingStartedMovies_section.html)
   - [Azure Cosmos DB Python Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-python)
