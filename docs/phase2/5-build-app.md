# Topic 5: Capstone Project

Now that you've got some Python skills under your belt, we've got an old codebase that needs some love! This Journal API project will test everything you've learned so far, and you'll be deploying it to the cloud in the next phase. Consider this your graduation project from the Python basics - time to put those skills to work!

## Prerequisites

This project uses Dev Containers to provide a consistent development environment. Install these tools before starting:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - Runs containers on your machine
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) - Opens projects inside containers

### What are Dev Containers?

Dev Containers let you use a container as a full development environment. Instead of manually installing Python, dependencies, and databases on your machine, everything runs inside a pre-configured container. This means:

- **Consistent environments** - No more "works on my machine" issues
- **Quick setup** - One click to get a fully working environment
- **Isolation** - Your project's tools don't interfere with other projects

**Resources:**
- [Dev Containers Overview](https://containers.dev/overview) - Official documentation
- [Dev Containers in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878) - Video tutorial (10 min)

Don't worry about mastering containers yet - you'll learn more in Phase 4. For now, just install the tools and follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the [starter repo](https://github.com/learntocloud/journal-starter)
2. All the instructions are in the README.md file

## Next Steps

Complete this capstone before moving to cloud deployment in the next phase. 
Make sure all API endpoints are working locally before proceeding. You will
use this same repository for the cloud deployment phase so DO NOT SKIP.
