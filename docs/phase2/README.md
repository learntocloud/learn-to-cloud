# Phase 2: Programming

Author: [GPS](https://twitter.com/madebygps)

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?


Programming is a fundamental skill for cloud engineering, enabling you to create, manage, and optimize cloud resources efficiently. 

You don't need to know how to build UIs but you need to know how to work with APIs and other cloud services like storage, databases, etc. Knowing how to program will make you more competitive in the hiring market. Additionally, understanding prompt engineering with tools like GitHub Copilot can enhance your coding productivity and capabilities.

In the previous step you were introduced to programming basics and wrote your first Bash script. You can now leverage this knowledge and apply it to your choice of programming language.

## How to break down this phase

There are several programming languages that are popular with Cloud: Python, Go, Rust, .NET, JavaScript. If you know any of these, you can continue using them, if not, I would go with [Python](https://www.python.org/). It's a very popular language and there are many quality free resources out there to learn it.

Continue adding your projects to your GitHub profile that you created in the past phase.  

I would suggest spending time on these two topics and this timeline:

| Order | Topic                           |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Learn to Code |
| 2 | Learn Prompt Engineering |

## Capstone Project: Serverless Movies API.

Create an API with serverless functions that display movie information. Don't forget to create a GitHub repo and document in your README.md

### Capstone Steps

1. **Create Your Cloud Infrastructure:**

    - Use an SDK to set up your cloud infrastructure.
    - You will need a NoSQL database, cloud storage, and serverless functions.
    - Depending on the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), additional setup steps may be required.

2. **Prepare Your Data:**
    - Find movie data or create it and store it in your cloud NoSQL db.
    - Store movie cover images of each movie in cloud storage.

3. **Create Serverless Functions:**
    1. **GetMovies:** Returns a JSON list of all movies in your database. Ensure the response includes a URL for the movie cover.
    2. **GetMoviesByYear:** Returns a list of movies released in a specified year. The year is provided by the client.
    3. **EXTRA CREDIT - GetMovieSummary:** Returns a summary generated by AI for a specified movie.

#### Example Data Model

Your movie data model could look like:
```json
{
    "title":"title of the movie",
    "releaseYear":"when the movie was released",
    "genre":"genre of the movie",
    "coverUrl":"url-to-image-in-cloud-storage"
}
```

#### Example API Endpoints

- **GetMovies** `yourapi.com/getmovies`

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Inception",
        "releaseYear": "2010",
        "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg"
     },
    {
        "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
        "releaseYear": "1994",
        "genre": "Drama, Crime",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/shawshank-redemption.jpg"
    },
    {
        "title": "The Dark Knight",
        "releaseYear": "2008",
        "genre": "Action, Crime, Drama",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/dark-knight.jpg"
    }
]
```

- **GetMoviesByYear** `yourapi.com/getmoviesbyyear/2010`

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Inception",
        "releaseYear": "2010",
        "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
        "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg"
    }
]
```

- **GetMovieSummary** `yourapi.com/getmoviesummary/inception`

```json
{
    "title": "Inception",
    "releaseYear": "2010",
    "genre": "Science Fiction, Action",
    "coverUrl": "https://example.com/inception.jpg",
    "generatedSummary": "A mind-bending sci-fi thriller about dream theft and manipulation."
}
```
