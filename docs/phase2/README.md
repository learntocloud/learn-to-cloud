# Phase 2: Programming & AI Integration

> ⏱️ **Estimated time:** 4-5 weeks

Welcome to Phase 2! This phase is all about programming with Python and integrating AI capabilities into your applications.

Programming is a fundamental skill for cloud engineering, enabling you to create, manage, and optimize cloud resources efficiently. Additionally, integrating AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications is becoming an essential skill for modern cloud engineers.

You don't need to know how to build UIs but you need to know how to work with APIs and other cloud services like storage, databases, and AI services. Knowing how to program and integrate AI will make you more competitive in the hiring market.

:::warning Important
As learners finish this phase, many will share their code. We recommend you **do not copy and paste** anybody's solution. You are only doing a disservice to yourself and will not make it in this field if that is the mentality you have.

Additionally, we recommend you turn off any AI assistants for code completion, though using AI to ask for explanations and clarification is highly recommended.
