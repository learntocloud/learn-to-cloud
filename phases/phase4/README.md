# Phase 4: DevOps fundamentals

Author: [GPS](https://twitter.com/madebygps)

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently from deployment to updates.
It's not specific to Cloud, as you can implement DevOps practices on-prem and in hybrid environments as well. DevOps is not limited to a single role. However most companies have dedicated roles to DevOps. If your aim is to become a DevOps engineer, this phase will get you started but you'll have to go deeper.

DevOps is a culture, and not a specific tool or service. Read up on what DevOps is. Each cloud platform has a suite of DevOps tools, I've linked a few articles here:

- [Microsoft - What is DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/#overview)
- [AWS - What is DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [IBM - A DevOps complete guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide)

I also think it's worth reading [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) it's a pretty fun read because it's a fictional story but it explains the importance of DevOps. But if you'd prefer something more like a textbook with similar ideas, check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/).

You should've completed the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) in the previous phase. That project introduces you to DevOps concepts, if you haven't, go back and do so.

## How to break down this phase

| Order | Topic                 |
|-------|-----------------------|
| 1 | CI/CD with GitHub Actions |
| 2 | IaC with Terraform |
| 3 | Containers with Docker |
| 4 | Containers orchestration with Kubernetes |
| 5 | Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana |

Of course feel free to spend as much time as you'd like, people have asked for a timeline and breakdown so I've added it. Every DevOps practice matters, but these are the most used on an entry/junior level. You should already be familiar with Version Control from Phase 2.

  - Why each one matters.
  - What each one accomplishes.
  - Most popular tools for each practice.

- Have personal projects in your GitHub. For at least 2 of your projects:
  - Have a CI/CD pipeline.
  - Have IaC files for each project.
  - Have monitoring implemented for each one.
    - Make sure you can understand the logging and metrics data.
  - If something were to go wrong with your project, understand how to troubleshoot.
