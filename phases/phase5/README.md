# Phase 5: Cloud Security Fundamentals

Author: [Dayspring Johnson](https://twitter.com/daycyberwox)

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

Security is the biggest challenge to cloud computing. As cloud adoption continues to grow, cloud security incidents and vulnerabilities are equally on the rise.

The individual cloud components you were introduced to in the previous phases all require security in some shape or form. Better yet, security has to be considered from every perspective in order to prevent malicious actors from finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in our cloud environments which could potentially lead to data or infrastructure compromise.

Here's one of my favorite articles by [Christophe Tafani-Dereeper](https://twitter.com/christophetd) that covers Cloud Security Breaches and Vulnerabilities:

- [Cloud Security Breaches and Vulnerabilities: 2021 in Review](https://blog.christophetd.fr/cloud-security-breaches-and-vulnerabilities-2021-in-review/)

I also recommend checking out [Securing DevOps: Security in the Cloud](https://www.manning.com/books/securing-devops) by [Julien Vehent](https://twitter.com/jvehent) which covers several of the core components for protecting cloud infrastructure, logging, detecting threats and so on. It even has practical and visual aids that help in learning these concepts.

Another book recommendation is [Practical Cloud Security: A Guide for Secure Design and Deployment](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-cloud-security/9781492037507/) by [Chris Dotson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dotson-6a9b55/). This book is a good complimentary resource to the previous book as it goes in-depth into various concepts, standards, frameworks and principles required for cloud security, and as the name implies, it is practical.

Always remember this, you can not secure what you do not understand, so make sure to understand the architectural and core components of the cloud so that you can properly secure them.
